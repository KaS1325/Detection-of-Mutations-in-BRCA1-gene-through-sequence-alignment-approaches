##  Results

Compared the human BRCA1 gene sequence with the mouse BRCA1 gene using BLASTn. Below is a summary of what we found:

###  BLAST Summary:
- *Human BRCA1 Accession*: NM_007294.4
- *Mouse BRCA1 Accession*: U36475.1
- *Alignment Length*: 6469 base pairs
- *Percent Identity*: ~76%
- *Gaps*: 109 (about 3%)
- *Best Match Strand*: Plus strand (same direction)

###  What This Means:
- A large portion of the BRCA1 gene is *similar between human and mouse*, showing that this gene is conserved (hasn't changed much through evolution).
- Some *differences (mutations)* were also found, which could be due to species-specific changes.
