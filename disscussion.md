##  Discussion

After comparing the BRCA1 gene sequences from human and mouse, I found about *76% similarity. This shows that many parts of the gene are **highly conserved*, meaning they are important and haven’t changed much through evolution.

The *conserved regions* are likely responsible for BRCA1’s role in *DNA repair*, which is a critical function in both species.

I also observed some *differences*, including:
- *Mismatches* (where the DNA bases are different)
- *Gaps* (insertions or deletions)

These changes may affect how BRCA1 works in mice compared to humans. However, the overall similarity suggests that *mice can still be good models* for studying BRCA1-related diseases like breast and ovarian cancer.

###  Future Scope
To better understand how these differences affect gene function, I could use additional tools such as:
- *Pfam* or *InterPro* to identify conserved protein domains
- *SIFT* or *PolyPhen* to predict if a mutation might be harmful
-
