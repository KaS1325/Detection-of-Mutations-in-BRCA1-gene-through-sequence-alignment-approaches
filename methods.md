##  Methods

This study used a comparative sequence alignment approach to detect mutations in the BRCA1 gene between Homo sapiens (human) and Mus musculus (mouse).

### 1. Sequence Collection
- *Human BRCA1 mRNA (Query):* NM_007294.4
- *Mouse BRCA1 mRNA (Subject):* U36475.1
- Both sequences were retrieved from the NCBI Nucleotide database in FASTA format.

### 2. BLAST Setup
- *Tool Used:* NCBI BLASTn ([https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov))
- *Search Type:* Nucleotide BLAST (BLASTn)
- *Database:* Nucleotide collection (nr/nt)
- *Organism Filter:* Mus musculus (taxid: 10090)

### 3. Parameters
- Default BLASTn parameters were used.
- The query was limited to mouse sequences to restrict results.

### 4. Analysis
- Top hit selected for comparison was mouse BRCA1 mRNA (U36475.1).
- Alignment identity, gaps, and mismatches were manually evaluated.
- Screenshots and aligned sequences were saved for documentation.
