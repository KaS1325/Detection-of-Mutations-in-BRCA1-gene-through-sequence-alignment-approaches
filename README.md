# Sequence-alignment-project

This repository documents a bionformatics research project focused on **sequence alignment**, utilizing real-world DNA or protein sequences using publicly available databases and tools such as **NCBI BLAST**, with optional Python-based automation for sequence retrieval and analysis.

---
## Objective

To perform sequence alignment in order to:
- Identify **molecular similarities and differences**
- Explore **evolutionary realtionships** across species
- Predict **conserved nad fucntional genomic or proteomic elements**
